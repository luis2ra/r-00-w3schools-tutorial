R Math


Simple Math

In R, you can use operators to perform common mathematical operations on numbers.

The + operator is used to add together two values:

> 10 + 5
[1] 15


And the - operator is used for subtraction:

> 10 - 5
[1] 5


Built-in Math Functions

R also has many built-in math functions that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

For example, the min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest number in a set:

> max(5, 10, 15)
[1] 15
> min(5, 10, 15)
[1] 5


The sqrt() function returns the square root of a number:

> sqrt(16)
[1] 4


The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of a number:

> abs(-4.7)
[1] 4.7


The ceiling() function rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and 
the floor() function rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:

> ceiling(1.4)
[1] 2
> floor(1.4)  
[1] 1
