R Print Output


Print

Unlike many other programming languages, you can output code in R without using a print function.

However, R does have a print() function available if you want to use it. This might be useful if 
you are familiar with other programming languages, such as Python, which often uses the print() function to output code.

And there are times you must use the print() function to output code, for example when working with 
for loops (which you will learn more about in a later chapter).

Conclusion: It is up to you whether you want to use the print() function to output code. However, when your code is 
inside an R expression (e.g. inside curly braces {} like in the example above), use the print() function to output the result.
