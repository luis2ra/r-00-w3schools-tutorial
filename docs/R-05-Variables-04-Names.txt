R Variable Names (Identifiers)


Variable Names

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for R variables are:
- A variable name must start with a letter and can be a combination of letters, digits, period(.)
  and underscore(_). If it starts with period(.), it cannot be followed by a digit.
- A variable name cannot start with a number or underscore (_)
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- Reserved words cannot be used as variables (TRUE, FALSE, NULL, if...)
