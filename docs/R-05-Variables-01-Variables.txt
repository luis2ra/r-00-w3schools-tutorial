R Variables


Creating Variables in R

Variables are containers for storing data values.

R does not have a command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a 
value to it. To assign a value to a variable, use the <- sign. To output (or print) the variable value, 
just type the variable name.

Example:

> name <- "Luis"
> age <- 47
> name
[1] "Luis"
> age
[1] 47
