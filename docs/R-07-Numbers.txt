R Numbers


Numbers

There are three number types in R:

 - numeric
 - integer
 - complex

Variables of number types are created when you assign a value to them.

Example:
x <- 10.5   # numeric
y <- 10L    # integer
z <- 1i     # complex


Numeric

A numeric data type is the most common type in R, and contains any number with or without a decimal, like: 10.5, 55, 787.

Example:
x <- 10.5
y <- 55


Integer

Integers are numeric data without decimals. This is used when you are certain that you will never create a variable 
that should contain decimals. To create an integer variable, you must use the letter L after the integer value:

Example:
x <- 1000L
y <- 55L


Complex

A complex number is written with an "i" as the imaginary part:

Example:
x <- 3+5i
y <- 5i


Type Conversion

You can convert from one type to another with the following functions:

 - as.numeric()
 - as.integer()
 - as.complex()

Example:
x <- 1L # integer
y <- 2 # numeric

# convert from integer to numeric:
a <- as.numeric(x)

# convert from numeric to integer:
b <- as.integer(y)
