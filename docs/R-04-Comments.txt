R Comments


Comments

Comments can be used to explain R code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution 
when testing alternative code.

Comments starts with a #. When executing code, R will ignore anything that starts with #.


Multiline Comments

Unlike other programming languages, such as Java, there are no syntax in R for multiline comments. However, 
we can just insert a # for each line to create multiline comments.
