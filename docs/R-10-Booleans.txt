R Booleans / Logical Values


Booleans (Logical Values)

In programming, you often need to know if an expression is true or false.

You can evaluate any expression in R, and get one of two answers, TRUE or FALSE.

When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and R returns the logical answer:

> 10 > 9
[1] TRUE
> 10 == 9
[1] FALSE
> 10 < 9
[1] FALSE
